Contact Person Application Documentation

Introduction
The Contact Person Application is a Java-based program designed to organize and manage a personal or professional contact list efficiently. It uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) structure to store and retrieve contact information. This structure ensures that all contacts are maintained in alphabetical order, making it easier to search, view, and manage the list.
This application is interactive, user-friendly, and provides core functionality such as adding, searching, deleting, and displaying contacts.
